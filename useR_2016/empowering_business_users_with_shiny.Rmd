## What We Gon' Talk 'Bout?

1. Why should we want to empower our business users?
2. A couple of examples of how we have used Shiny within Allstate
   to engage our business partners with analytics
3. Some notes about using Shiny in this way

## Empowering?  Huh?

\begin{itemize}[<+->]
    \item Why to we build things?
    \begin{itemize}
        \item<.-> To pay the bills
        \item<.-> Because it's fun
        \item<.-> To have an impact
    \end{itemize}
    \item Building positive relationships with others is necessary to 
                    make an impact in a fast-moving world
    \item<.-> Transparency and sharing ownership of work is often critical
                    and can often supersede the work itself
    \item Shiny can be used as an effective tool for building
                    relationships between data workers and business users
\end{itemize}

## Why Shiny?

- R's open source community
- Relatively low barrier to entry (e.g. no need to learn HTML/CSS/JS)
- Exploiting your existing code for data analysis and visualization

## Example 1: Data Exploration

\begin{itemize}[<+->]
    \item Working with a technology group to proactively identify server outages
    \begin{itemize}
        \item<.-> E.g. based on recent changes, assigned resources, and call notes
    \end{itemize}
    \item This data is primarily user-supplied and hence is very messy and nuanced
    \item<.-> Our business partners had some experience analyzing this data but weren't
            able to dive as deep as they wanted
    \item Shiny helped us easily collaborate with our business user 
                    to explore and understand this data
    \begin{itemize}
        \item<.-> We get to leverage their persepective on the business-side of the data (How do software changes get scheduled and how is that documented?)
        \item<.-> Our business partners get to leverage our experience working with data
    \end{itemize}
\end{itemize}

## Example 2: Delivering Models

\begin{itemize}[<+->]
    \item Working with claims adjusters to give them fast and quantitatively based
  estimates on expected claim amounts early on in the process
    \begin{itemize}
        \item<.-> E.g. for procatively reaching for quick payments when we expect a claim
    to be extensive
    \end{itemize}
    \item Again, this data is primarily user-supplied and hence is very messy and nuanced
    \item<.-> Our business partners had some experience analyzing this data but weren't
  able to dive as deep as they wanted
    \item Shiny helped us quickly create a prototype application to mine adjuster notes and
  provide
    \begin{itemize}
        \item<.-> We get to leverage their perspective on cases (Qualitative information relevant to the claim that is hard to measure)
        \item<.-> Our business partners get to leverage model that suggest actions and provide
    a quantitative context for those suggestions
    \end{itemize}
\end{itemize}

## Some Notes to Using Shiny in this Way

\begin{itemize}[<+->]
    \item Shiny is a fantastic **supplement** to great work but does not **replace** great work
    \item<.-> As with any tool, it requires:
    \begin{itemize}
        \item<.-> Strategic direction
        \begin{itemize}
            \item<.-> E.g. what does this Shiny app really need to help us do
        \end{itemize}
    \end{itemize}
    \begin{itemize}
        \item Good communication
        \begin{itemize}
            \item<.-> E.g. in making assumptions and setting expectations
        \end{itemize}
    \end{itemize}
    \begin{itemize}
        \item Good data work
        \begin{itemize}
            \item<.-> E.g. in preparing and modeling data
        \end{itemize}
    \end{itemize}
\end{itemize}
