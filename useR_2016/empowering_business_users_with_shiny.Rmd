## Agenda

1. What do we mean by "empowering" business users?
2. Two examples to show how we have used Shiny within Allstate
   to engage our business partners with analytics
3. Some observations about using Shiny in this way

## How Do We Empower Business Users?

\begin{itemize}[<+->]
    \item Helping them make more informed decisions with data
    \item Building relationships by:
    \begin{itemize}
        \item<.-> Being transparent
        \item<.-> Sharing ownership
    \end{itemize}
    \item Shiny can be an effective tool for building these relationships
\end{itemize}

## Why Shiny?

- R's active open source community
- Low barrier to entry
    - E.g. No need to learn HTML/CSS/JS
- Exploiting your existing R code

## Example 1: Exploring Messy Data

\begin{itemize}[<+->]
    \item Case: A technology group wants to be able to proactively identify server outages
    \item Data: Primarily user-documented and hence is very messy and inconsistent
    \begin{itemize}
        \item<.-> E.g. recent changes, assigned resources, and meeting notes that describe incidents
                  along the way
    \end{itemize}
    \item<.-> Our business partners had some experience analyzing this data but were not
              able to dive as deep as they wanted
\end{itemize}

## Example 1: How Did Shiny Help?

\begin{itemize}
    \item Shiny helped us more easily collaborate with our business users to explore 
          and understand this data
    \begin{itemize}
        \item We get to leverage their perspective on how the data is generated
        \item Our business partners get to leverage our experience working with and asking
              questions about data
    \end{itemize}
\end{itemize}

## Example 1: The App!

## Example 2: "Delivering" Models

\begin{itemize}[<+->]
    \item Case: Claims adjusters want to be able to make faster decisions
    \item Data: A mixture of closed- and free-form data on claims
    \begin{itemize}
        \item<.-> E.g. Involved parties, assessed damages, and case notes from
                  the adjuster
    \end{itemize}
    \item<.-> Claims adjusters have worked extensively with this data but need help understanding
              what can help predict claim amounts early in the process
\end{itemize}

## Example 2: How Did Shiny Help?

\begin{itemize}
    \item Shiny helped us quickly create a prototype application to provide 
          estimates of claim amount and allow adjusters to update incorrect information
    \begin{itemize}
        \item We get to leverage their perspective on claims cases
        \item Our business partners get to leverage our experience building predictive models
    \end{itemize}
\end{itemize}

## Some Notes to Using Shiny in this Way

\begin{itemize}
    \item Shiny is a fantastic \textbf{supplement} to great work but does not \textbf{replace}
          great work
    \item As with any tool, it requires:
    \begin{itemize}
        \item Strategic direction
        \item Good communication
        \item Good data work
    \end{itemize}
\end{itemize}
